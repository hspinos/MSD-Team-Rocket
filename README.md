We took Eliza one step further, by providing the user 
with recommendations that coincide with how they are 
feeling. We use the BeautifulSoup library and 
WebScraper to pull data from the web to use for our 
recommendation list. 

For example if a user suggest they are happy, then the 
database would pull media resources that go hand in 
hand with being happy. Media resources configure of 
just books as for now, but we are planning are adding 
movies and tv shows. If a user suggest they are
depressed the system would essentially provide them
with a media recommendation to cheer them up.
